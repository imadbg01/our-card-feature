## My process

I stared by structure a semantic html layout, and when i start css i don't want to have a lot of classes and i found it hard to with meaningful names so to solve that I used the old shool OOP css, I don't now if is a good approach but it's solve my problem with names for now anywhere

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

in first look at the design I was thinking that well be easy to solve with [CSS Grid](https://web.dev/learn/css/grid/) and it is for the mobile and tablet version, but when I stared with desktop version I stared to get some difficulties to get it look as close to design as possible, I wasn't abele to solve it using _grid-template-areas_, so I disable it in the desktop version and I used instate _grid-column_ and _grid-row_ like so

```css
@media (min-width: 65.0111rem) {
  .container {
    max-width: 95rem;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(0.5rem, 1fr) minmax(0, 65.5rem) minmax(0.5rem, 1fr);
  }

  .header > p {
    max-width: 50ch;
    margin-inline: auto;
  }
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: minmax(0.5rem, 1fr) repeat(9, 1fr) minmax(0.5rem, 1fr);
    grid-template-areas: none;
  }

  .grid-container > section:nth-child(1) {
    grid-column: 2 / 5;
    grid-row: 2/4;
  }

  .grid-container > section:nth-child(2) {
    grid-column: 5 / 8;
    grid-row: 1 / 3;
  }

  .grid-container > section:nth-child(3) {
    grid-column: 5 / 8;
    grid-row: 3 / 6;
  }
  .grid-container > section:nth-child(4) {
    grid-column: 8 / 11;
    grid-row: 2 / 4;
  }
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
